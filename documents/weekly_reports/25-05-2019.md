## Task in this week:
- Tracking whole body from T-pose to frame 1
![segmentation_point cloud from T-pose to frame 1](frame0_1.jpg)
- Visualize the skeleton that fitted to frame 1. The execution time is around 20 minutes due to the large number of points in the point cloud, we can use the techniques to reduce it
