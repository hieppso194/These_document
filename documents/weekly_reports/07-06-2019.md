## Done task:
- The first draft of my first year report:
+ The document is available at: [My first year report](https://www.overleaf.com/8979375658mwdkvqvssbbc
)
- Align correctly skeleton to first frame (not T-pose) of the motion
- Read papers about machine learning based motion tracking methods to write
the first year report: (B. Taskarf D. Anguelov and A. Ng. “Discriminative learning of Markovrandom fields for segmentation of 3D scan data”,
,J. Rihan G. Rogez and P. H. Torr. “"Randomized trees for human posedetection")
## Not done task
- Motion tracking of the whole motion. The orientation of ellipsoid not correct
from 3rd frame. The points segmentation still good because of the small difference between 2 frames of motion
