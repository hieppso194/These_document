Done task:
- Spherical harmonics displacement for one bone
- Pipeline with Blender and MakeHuman to align well the ellipsoidal skeleton to T-pose point cloud

Next task:
- Spherical harmonics displacement for the whole body to approximate the surface of tracked object
- Apply into each frame of the animation
- Make some noise to point clouds and evaluate the surface of these clouds
- Show the problem with noisy data
- Use Deep Learning to reconstruct the missing point, error points

Next meeting with Franck will be 26-04-2019 at 2p.m
