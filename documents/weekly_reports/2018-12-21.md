# Discussion
- Problem with shirt, large clothes
- Starting with the perfect data, we can add noise, add interpolation and extrapolation
- MakeHuman software (export human characters, apply skeleton, skinning) -> Unity -> perect data -> recode Chai papers

- Propose the first contribution:
	+ eclipsoid of visible parts
	+ ML of several examples missing + visible parts
	+ expected output: simulate missing data
	+ generation of open data

# Todolist
Task 1: Make Human + Unity (1 week)
Task 2: Reproduce Chai Work based on perfect data
Task 3: Automate alignment of Eclipsoids (1m)
Task 4: Adapt Chai approach for 1 point of view (2m)
Task 5: Test on MHAD database + kinect data (2w)
Task 6: write paper (5th June)
Task 7: State of the art
