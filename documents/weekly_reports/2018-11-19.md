## DepthCut: Improved Depth Edge Estimation Using Multiple Unreliable Channels ['link'](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2018/depthcut/paper_docs/GuerreroEtAl_DepthCut_CGI2018.pdf)
1. Depth contour and crease from 3 channels:
	- color: reliable locations for contour edges of untextured objects, but may
also contain unwanted texture and shadow edges
	- estimated disparity: reliable with highly texture regions but inaccurate at disoclusions
	- estimated normals: surface orientation
2. The neural network (CNN)
	- It aims at building a data-driven fusion of channels 
	- Its architecture is [`encoder-decoder`](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf)

# Motion Capture System
## A quick view
- [An overview of motion capture system](http://ijirts.org/volume4issue1/IJIRTSV4I1009.pdf)
## Current popular systems
1. Optical motion capture
	- It uses cameras to record actor movements, the cameras used can capture up to 2000 fps
	- The markers are made of some material intended to stand out from the surroundings, often some reflecting material or LED:s
	- The cameras are placed at different angles towards the actor and a sequence is filmed which afterwards can be analyzed and the positions of the markers stored in a computer.
	- Advs: capable of recording the most complex motions with the least deterioration in
quality. And It also allows the actor to move unhindered, without any suit or other
measurement devices attached to the body
	- Disadvs: the problems when markers are occlued. Also the processing time is very high and the data
produced by an optical motion capture must often be adjusted and cleaned up and this
combined with the demanding calculations makes it a non real time system. 
	- An Optical motion capture system often costs between $100,000 and $250,000

2. Electromagnetic system
	- The actor wears a suit with magnetic sensors attach to it.
	- Advs: the data is clean and the processing time is very low
	- Disadvs: the sensitivity of the sensors that
easily can pick up electromagnetic noise as well as the presence of ferrous metal. 
	- An electromagnetic system costs between $5,000 and $150,000
3. Electromechanical systems
	- the actor wear a mechanical suit that is composed of potentiometers measuring the joint angles and extension
	- Advs: The systemâ€™s processing-time is very fast and there is no electromagnetic interference
	- Disavs: the suit is encumbering and heavy
	- An electromechanical system cost between $5,000 and $10,000.
