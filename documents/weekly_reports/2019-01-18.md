My finished task:
- Understand clearly Chai paper
- Make a detail report and code plan (available at: https://www.overleaf.com/read/cjqphbxggptd)
- Deploy some code: ellipsoid data structure, exploit obj file and visualize it by using lib in Python (model is generated from MakeHuman as fbx file and is converted to obj file in Maya), try non linear optimization

Next task:
-deploy the flow: fbx file (model+animation) -> set of obj files -> visualize it as set of point clouds for our perfect data
