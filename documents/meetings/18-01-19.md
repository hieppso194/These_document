Summary of weekly meeting 18-01-2019:
- Discuss about Hiep's stay in Rennes, there is a fund :)
- Discuss about pipline to generate perfect data, a new pipeline: MakeHuman -> fbx file for model -> Maya/Unity to add animation -> export to set of .obj file
-> set of point clouds (I tested that it is ok with model, i will make it with model+animation)
- Build ellipsoidal skeleton and align it to point cloud (take a long time with manually alignment)
