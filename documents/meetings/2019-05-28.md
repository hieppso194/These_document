Discussion:
- Automatically align for first frame of motion because there are
drawbacks with the manually aligning skeleton to T-pose
- Reduce the complexity of mesh
- Parallel programming with segmentation task
- Run motion capture with the motion whose first frame is T-pose to
test Chai paper
- Babull motion capture on the treadmills with Chai paper with the contribution about
aligning skeleton automatically to frame 1
