# In the meeting:
- Plan Hiep's short stay in Rennes (10/12 - 12/12). Its objectives are:
	+ Show actual problem in motion capture design
	+ 2 actual experiments (tennis in Monday 10/12 and soccer in Tuesday 11/12)
	
- Frank comes to Reims in 21/12

# Todolist:
- Provide a short report design for our motion capture design (specifications, layer
, different blocks) by discovering Computer Vision problem with motion data capture

- Get familiar with deep learning in human motion analysis, especially deep
reinforcement learning in 3D mesh animation
